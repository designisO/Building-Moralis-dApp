## Building a dApp using Moralis.io SDK

### Overview

Created a simple dApp that allows users to connect to the metamask wallet. You also can retrieve data of historically and real time of the Metamask wallet. In this project it allowed me to learn more about the SDK of Moralis. I was able to explore the cloud functions that support the backend of the dApp. I also was able to review the dashboard which shows the users logged in on the server. Using the console I was able to confirm the loging in and out. Enjoy.

### Description

Moralis IO

- The Firebase of Crypto
- managed backend for blockchain projects.
- Automatically sync balances of users into the databse, build indexes, watch smart contract events and much more. 
- features are accessed through their easy to use SDK.
- all features Moralis provide are cross chain by default. 

Moralis Servers?
- Database : Where all your dta will be stored.
- Cloud code: backend code in your dApp. Write functions in JS which can then be triggered by either calling it from your dAPp.
- SDK: The JavaScript SDK is how your dApp interacts with your Moralis Server. You can authenticate users, get user data, fetch balances, NFTs or transactions.

Prerequisites:
-Web3 development, quering databases, workign with objects in JavaScript.
